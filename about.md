Hi there!
My name is Ben Butler and I am loving life with my beautiful wife and two young sons. We have an amazing life here in Boise, ID and I could not immagine a more exciting and happy time. I started this page as a way to learn a bit about the git version control system and to get a blog and website put together. I'm sure you'll see and hear all the trials and tribulations of both me learning git and life here in Idaho.
