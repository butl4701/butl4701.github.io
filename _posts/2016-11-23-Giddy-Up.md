A long time ago I became intrigued with the idea of writing a blog - A place to capture random ramblings, thoughts, and observations about life. Being a big nerd the one thing that often tripped me up was the need to decide on which platform to use to host said blog. Low and behold what I didn't realize is that IT DOESN'T MATTER! What does matter is that you put yourself out there and start writing! So here I am writing. My plan for this blog is to use the space to document a big home remodel that we will be taking on starting next spring (2017). We have already taken steps to get this whole process started and I will likely back-date a couple posts to bring the blog current. It is a super exciting time as we have been busting at the seams and starved for space and the creature comforts of not being interrupted by a two year old whilst going to the bathroom!

So hang on to your hats! It's going to be a fun ride!
